# FC-Chess
## Welcome
First of all I'd like to welcome you to FC Chess. I think I don't need to explain what it is, so I rather talk about my aims during this project. I want to achieve a more or less good looking GUI and cross-platform Chess game. In order to document my progress, I'll use the [wiki](https://github.com/AdmiralEmser/FC-Chess/wiki/Home). There I will also write down some thoughts about my ideas including those that didn't make it into the project.
